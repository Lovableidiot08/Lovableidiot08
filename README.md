I'm just an average joe wizarding the world of coding on my own and it seems pretty challenging alone, even understanding the basics always talkes time and pateince to master such things allowing me to venture and understand it better 
I'm interested in becoming a full front end developer, even though I'm taking an entire full web development bootcamp in understanding everything it has to do in both front and back end coding
I'm currently learning all the things I need to perfect the skill in both front and back end but will reahc more on preferment on front-end
reach me at my email if ya want to collaborate< i'm very easy to get along with and a quick learner in anything you guys give me!
